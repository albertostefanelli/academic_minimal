                <p>In recent years there has been an increasing interest in whether populism is related to opinion extremity. Yet, research on the topic offers little direct evidence on whether and under which conditions populist ideas at the individual level are related to policy extremity and inter-party dislike. This paper aims to fill this gap by focusing on the reasons populist individuals hold more or less extreme opinions. Using data from the 2016 American National Electoral Study, I find that populist attitudes are a strong correlate of both ideological extremity and affective polarization, yet this association is conditional on respondent’s party affiliation. Populism is related to higher levels of ideological extremity among Democrats and stronger negative leader evaluations among Republicans. This finding indicates that the relationship between populism and citizens’ political judgements varies depending on the ability of populist leaders to make certain dimensions of the competition salient (i.e. ideological or affective) and exploit pre-existing ideological and partisan rivalries (i.e. party identity).</p>

                <p>Over the past decades, scholars have extensively studied the ideological positions of radical individuals. Yet, most research focuses on vote choice and attitudes towards particular policy issues. This paper sets out to identify the abstract and general elements (i.e., antagonism, dogmatism and populism) that constitute the ontological core of radical belief systems and assess their prevalence among the general population. Using data from the 2019 Belgian National Electoral Study, we employ a person-centred approach to classify individuals into ideological profiles. Contrary to the widespread assumption that radical individuals are a more "radicalised" version of mainstream voters, we provide evidence that they have a markedly different understanding of politics and society, and that political radicalism is not monolithic as there exist multiple, alternative, and more nuanced, non-mainstream ideologies. We also found that, compared to voters of the radical right, radical left voters are less likely to endorse a black-and-white understanding of politics despite showing high levels of populism and antagonism. Education, perceived social class, and trust in political institutions influence the degree to which individuals subscribe to different belief systems. </p>

                <p>Objectives: To investigate country-specific drivers and barriers of positive COVID-19 vaccine intentions in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), one of the two entities comprising Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
                <p>Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used, using an online behavioural insights survey tool adapted to the context of FBiH. Three survey waves, each including approximately 1,000 adults, were conducted in July, September and December 2020. Fixed-effects regression analysis was used to explore the drivers, barriers and attitudes towards accepting a future COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
                <p>Results: COVID-19 risk perception, trust in health institutions and negative affect were positive predictors of positive COVID-19 vaccine intentions, as were living in urban areas and having a college education (versus having primary or secondary education). Conversely, being female and feeling that the pandemic was overhyped by the media and the country of vaccine production were negative predictors.
                <p>Conclusion: This study provided snapshots on the state of attitudes regarding future COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in 2020. These findings provided useful insights into the efforts to introduce and roll out the COVID-19 vaccines in FBiH. Further efforts should focus on better understanding the demographic, cultural, and behavioral contexts of COVID-related vaccination perceptions in FBiH. </p>

                <p>The article explores the reasons for the success of the Five Star Movement (FSM), one of the most electorally successful yet peculiar populist parties in the European context. I first analyze the main characteristics of the FSM in relation to the principal conceptual dimensions of European populism. In particular, I briefly examine the FSM profile and organization, underlining the key elements that make the FSM unique. Secondly, I review the electoral history of Grillo's movement. I analyze the results of the main national and local elections, looking at the transformations in its organization and strategy. Thirdly, I investigate the consolidation of the FSM at the local level using three indicators: the FSM's electoral performance, the consolidation of its organization, and the use of preferential voting by its voters. I conclude by examining the transformation of the FSM electorate in relation to the socio-demographic profile of its voters.</p>

           <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>Despite the importance of power analysis for survey-experimental techniques, power considerations are often disregarded in the design of conjoint experiments. The main goal of this article is to provide rigorous guidance on how the number of experimental conditions, trials, and subjects impact the statistical power of conjoint experiments.  To this end, we first conducted an extensive literature review to gauge the experimental designs typically employed in conjoint studies and the plausible effect sizes discovered in the literature.  Using the information gathered from the literature review, we explore the statistical properties of a wide range of commonly employed designs using a simulation-based framework that employs a flexible data-generating model.  Results show that—even with a relatively large sample size and the number of trials—conjoint experiments are not well suited to draw inferences for designs with large numbers of experimental conditions (> 15) and relatively small effect sizes (< 1000). Based on our simulation results, we develop a web application that can be used by researches to perform a priori power analysis and hence achieve adequate design for future conjoint experiments.</p>

           <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>Popular support for freedom of speech is generally high. At the same time, citizens are often willing to censor speech acts they do not agree with. We investigate this paradox, conceptually and empirically, by examining the relationship between populism and freedom of speech. We find that populist individuals display higher support for free speech in its principled and abstract form. Yet, at the same time, they are willing to restrict the rights of their ideological opponents. Left-wing populist individuals are more likely to allow a speech against multinational corporations, yet they tend to deny the same right for a speech against immigrants. On the contrary, right-wing populist individuals are more likely to tolerate a speech against immigrants but less likely to do so for a speech against multinational corporations. These results underline the tendency of populist individuals on both sides of the ideological spectrum to instrumentally trade-off free speech for their ideological interests.</p>

           <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>With both affective polarization and populism on the rise in several countries, many have proposed a link between the two phenomena. Yet, research offers little direct evidence on whether populist individuals are more polarized. This paper aims to fill this gap by using CSES data from 25 elections in 21 countries to provide a comparative account of the relationship between populism and affective polarization at the individual level. We show that neither populist attitudes nor populist voting are not generally related to higher levels of affective polarization. Instead, we identify a curvilinear relationship wherein both populists and anti-populists exhibit high levels of polarization, with substantial variations across countries. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that populism is universally associated with heightened affective polarization, suggesting that it may not be the sole responsible behind the upsurge in affective polarization observed in some Western democracies.</p>

                <p>The goal of this study is to examine heterogeneity in citizens’ commitment to democratic principles by their i) left, centre, or right political orientation; ii) populist or mainstream political tendencies. We use a candidate-choice survey experiment fielded in 7 different Latin American countries. Results show that individuals trade off democracy for differ- ent policy preferences and priorities (i.e. the left for leftist policies; the right for rightist policies; the centre for centrist policies).</p>

                <p>We test whether the entrance of populist parties in parliament changes the way citizens think about immigration and European Integration. Making use of exogenous variation created through differences in electoral thresholds, we causally assess that the representation of populist parties is associated with changes in attitudes. The results suggest the presence of attitude polarisation across the L-R ideological spectrum: left-wing individuals move towards more progressive positions while right-wing voters become more conservative.</p>

                <p>This paper aims to examine the relationship between populism and the dual character of liberal democracy. Our empirical findings show that populist individuals tend to endorse a majoritarian conception of democracy characterized by anti-pluralistic tendencies and a preference for direct governance. Simultaneously, we find that populist individuals exhibit less support for individual freedom and checks and balances, believing that the government should have unhindered rule.</p>
